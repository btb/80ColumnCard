Where they were accompanied by the following text:
>==Videx Videoterm Fonts==
>
>The binary font files in this folder were created from screenshots of the scanned Videx Videoterm manual.
>
>Most care was taken to verify them by comparing them overlaid to said screenshots.
>
>The only font that is not 100% accurate is the symbol font, as some characters were not correctly visible.

However the "Symbol" image appears to be entirely corrupted.

Identically named files can be found elsewhere, such as mirrors of 
ftp.apple.asimov.net, however some of the files are different.

The file:
* Videx Videoterm Character ROM Graphics.bin
was taken from a mirror of ftp.apple.asimov.net, and it appears to be the 
"Line Drawing Character Set" listed as Figure 5 in the manual, though it 
also contains Japanese characters and the placements don't seem to 
correspond with those in the manual.
