# Character Generator ROMS

The following files were extracted from the Videx Videoterm Utilities disk 1.3:
* ascii.bin
* ascii uc.bin
* epson.bin
* french.bin
* german.bin
* katakana.bin
* norsk.bin
* russian.bin
* super & subscript.bin
* symbol.bin

These files were posted online and are believed to be dumps from genuine Videx Videoterm chips:
* videx inverse - top left.bin
* videx std 7x9 - top right.bin

The following files were taken from the Apple II Documentation Project, 
presumably hand-copied from the Videx Videoterm manual by Marc S. Ressl:
* Videx Videoterm Character ROM APL.bin
* Videx Videoterm Character ROM Spanish.bin

The file:
* Videx Videoterm Character ROM Graphics.bin
was taken from a mirror of ftp.apple.asimov.net, and it appears to be the 
"Line Drawing Character Set" listed as Figure 5 in the manual, though it 
also contains Japanese characters and the placements don't seem to 
correspond with those in the manual.
