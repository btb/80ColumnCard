Where they were accompanied by the following text:
>==Videx Videoterm Fonts==
>
>The binary font files in this folder were created from screenshots of the scanned Videx Videoterm manual.
>
>Most care was taken to verify them by comparing them overlaid to said screenshots.
>
>The only font that is not 100% accurate is the symbol font, as some characters were not correctly visible.

However the "Symbol" image appears to be entirely corrupted.

Identically named files can be found elsewhere, such as mirrors of ftp.apple.asimov.net, however some of the files are different.
